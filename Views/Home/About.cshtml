        Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, 
        and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. It stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as Peter Venkman, 
        Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler, three eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business 
        in New York City. It also stars Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis, and features Annie Potts, 
        William Atherton, and Ernie Hudson in supporting roles.

        Based on his own fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived Ghostbusters as a project starring 
        himself and John Belushi, in which they would venture through time and space battling supernatural 
        threats. Following Belushi's death in 1982, and with Aykroyd's concept deemed financially impractical, 
        Ramis was hired to help rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic. 
        It was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects, and Columbia Pictures, concerned about 
        its relatively high $25–30 million budget, had little faith in its box office potential. Filming took 
        place from October 1983 to January 1984, in New York City and Los Angeles. Due to competition for 
        special effects studios among various films in development at the time, Richard Edlund used part of 
        the budget to found Boss Film Studios, which employed a combination of practical effects, miniatures, 
        and puppets to deliver the ghoulish visuals.
